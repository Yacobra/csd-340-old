        <p class="intro">Hello, my name is Jacob Darling. I am the youngest of three brothers and am currently studying to become a software developer. I was born and raised in Southern California and could not imagine living anywhere else.</p>
        
        <p>I have always been intrigued by technology and how it has slowly seeped into every corner of our daily routines. I wanted to become part of this advancement, creating a better life for people everywhere. <span class="sentence">The future is what we make of it.</span></p>
        
        <p>As a child I was always a peformer. My last few years in high school was spent doing theater. This inspired me to apply to work at Disneyland.</p>
        
        <p>I am furthering my education in hopes to find a career path that allows me to work mostly from home. Technology is is always advancing and I want to be part of that journey.</p>
