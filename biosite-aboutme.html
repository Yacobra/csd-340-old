        <h1>Short Interview</h1>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Tell Me About Yourself:</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Julian Bodda-Ronquillo, and I just got married! I live in Southern California with my new husband, Kyle. I am a very spiritual person, and it is no mistake that I chose a black cat to bring into the family. Astoroth, Ast'ro for short, is our little bundle of darkness and the perfect familiar.</p>
            <h2>What Are Your Hobbies?</h2>
            <p>I enjoy spending time with friends and playing video games when I'm not. I have a large collection of crystals, as I believe in their healing energies. My main area of interest is in astrology and I often will help others discover their big three.</p>
            <h2>Oh? What's that?</h2>
            <p>Well, most everyone will answer their sun sign when you inquire about their zodiac. For example I was born May 13 which is in Taurus, simply meaning the Sun was pointed towards that constellation the day I was born. It represents your core identity while the Moon sign deals with emotions, and the Rising sign is how you present yourself. The time of birth is needed to discover the moon and rising signs. The Rising sign, sometimes called Ascendant, is the constellation behind the eastern horizon as you are born. My big three would be Taurus Sun, Gemini Moon, and Pisces Rising and these lend to certain patterns. After reading my chart, you would discover the tendency to be a hard worker, dependable, stubborn, and a major foodie represented by the Taurus Sun and flighty emotional responses and a penchant for talking about feelings from the Gemini Moon.</p>
            <h2>What Accomplishment Are You Most Proud Of?</h2>
            <p>I have used my knowledge of astrology to assist in balancing my personal and professional life. There are several relationships I was able to nurture or repair due to my deeper understanding of people's underlying motivations and tendencies. And this includes myself! I have done a much deeper dive into my own astrological chart including several more celestial bodies and their signs.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>What Are Your Goals?</h2>
            <p>I would like to write a book someday to share astrological insights. There are several existing materials on this subject but I would want to expand on the topic including my other practices with Tarot and healing crystals. All of these subjects can have a strong stigma associated with them and I think a more modern approach will demystify what people are unfamiliar with.</p>
            <h2>How Do You Deal with Stressful Situations?</h2>
            <p>I know it is important to stay focused, I typically do my best to remain grounded in the situation so I know my surroundings. Communication is key, often things can be time sensitive or a simple misunderstanding and can be best resolved if people just talk. This can be new for some and prove difficult for others, but I highly recommend talking it out, whatever it may be.</p>
            <h2>Describe a Time You Had to Adapt to a Significant Change.</h2>
            <p>I was a character performer at the Disneyland resort for several years, and during my time there, I eventually became a manager within the Character department. This meant that many of my peers that I worked with in the trenches now had to answer to me as their supervisor. I learned quickly which relationships needed to remain professional and how I could adequately separate my personal and professional life.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>What Are Your Strengths?</h2>
            <p>I am reliable and determined. If there is something you need help with that needs to get done before a deadline, I am the perfect person to call to your aide. I have a curious mind and love to learn about new topics. I am quick to adapt this knowledge into my routine. I am very intuitive, and as we know, communication is key. So, I have seldom had issues explaining my point of view to several types of thinkers at once.</p>
            <h2>What Motivates You?</h2>
            <p>I am motivated by helping others; it is what initially sparked my fascination with astrology. As a kid, I would always try to help others in the way that I wanted to be helped. This makes sense on a basic level, but each person is different, and not all solutions are copy and paste. Horoscopes introduced me to astrology, and from there, I was hooked. The connections I can make by understanding and exploring the mystical help me form strong community bonds.</p>
            <h2>Describe a Time You Demonstrated Leadership.</h2>
            <p>Outside of my role as a leader, I was able to demonstrate leadership when I led a workshop for people who were interested in learning about astrology, healing crystals, and tarot. I was able to set up informative displays on each topic and had knowledgeable personnel for each booth. To spur interest, there were Tarot readings, and I ensured there were plenty of time slots as I was available to do some of the readings myself. Each guest received a small crystal that would be unique to them and their experience. It was amazing being able to share my passions with others and teach them something new about themselves.</p>
